! A CFG is a graph where nodes represent basic-blocks and edges represent
! control transition between these blocks.
!
! A BB node is specified as follows:
!   [0..9]+ : ([0..9]+( [0..9]+)*)?
!      ^                ^
!    BB ID         BB Succ IDs
!
! No extensive error checking is performed since this is a temp solution till
! a CFG generator is implemented (see issue: #3)
!

! This CFG is takn from Section 9.2.1 of [0].
